# Changelog

## v2.1.0 (2022-11-29)

### Improvements

- Now you can have a lot more control over your http client, including
  selecting what client you are using from the adapters available for
  [Tesla](https://github.com/elixir-tesla/tesla).
  You can also easily add logging and tracing with middleware.

### Backward Incompatible Changes

- No longer directly using hackney it's still possible to use it through a
  Tesla adapter. To keep all your tweaks working correctly you'll need to
  add these settings:

  In mix.exs
    ```elixir
    # mix.exs
    defp deps do
      # Add the dependency
      [
        {:oauth2, "~> 2.1"},
        {:hackney, "~> 1.18"} # This is the new line you need to add
      ]
    end
    ```

  In config:
    ```elixir
    config :oauth2, adapter: Tesla.Adapter.Hackney
    ```

## v2.0.1 (2022-06-20)

### Bug fixes

- Fix incorrect Accept header when requesting token

## v2.0.0 (2019-07-15)

### Bug fixes (possibly backwards incompatible)

- Ensure that the OAuth client is authenticated via Authorization header as
  described in the spec (#131).

## v1.0.1 (2019-04-12)

### Bug fixes

- Always use the provided serializer if one is registered (#132)

## v1.0.0 (2019-03-13)

### Backward Incompatible Changes

- There is no longer a default serializer for `application/json`. Please make
  sure to register a serializer with `OAuth2.Client.put_serializer/3`.
- Serializers are now registered via `OAuth2.Client.put_serializer/3`.
  This change allows applications wrapping `oauth2` a way to provide default
  serializers without requiring the user to manually configure a serializer.

## v0.9.4 (2018-10-18)

### Improvements

- Relaxed `hackney` version requirements

## v0.9.3 (2018-08-13)

### Bug fixes

- Various type specs fixed

## v0.9.2 (2017-11-17)

### Bug fixes

## v0.9.1 (2017-03-10)

### Improvements

## v0.9.0 (2017-02-02)

### Improvements

- Provides better support for configuring `request_opts` that will be used on
  every request. This is useful for configuring SSL options, etc.
- Provides support for `hackney`s streaming of responses.
- Better warnings when a serializer isn't properly configured.

### Backward Incompatible Changes

- Responses with status codes between `400..599` will now return `{:error, %OAuth2.Response{}}` instead of `{:ok, %OAuth2.Response{}}`
- When using the `!` versions of functions, `{:error, %OAuth2.Response{}}` will
  be converted to an `%OAuth2.Error{}` and raised.

## v0.8.3 (2017-01-26)

- Fix compile-time warnings for Elixir 1.4
- Fix dialyzer warnings on `@type params`

- Fixed regression in handling `text/plain` content-type for tokens in #74

## v0.8.0 (2016-10-05)

### Improvements

- Added `OAuth2.Client.basic_auth/1` convenience function.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed broken `RefreshToken` strategy reported in #66
- Fixed an issue where checking the `content-type` was defaulting to
  `application/json` causing Poison to explode.

## v0.7.0 (2016-08-16)

### Improvements

- Add support for custom serializers based on MIME types.
- Remove dependency on `HTTPoison` in favor of using `hackney` directly.
- Remove dependency on `mimetype_parser`.
- `Poison` is now only a `test` dependency.

### Bug Fixes

- `expires_in` values that are returned as strings are now properly parsed into integers for `expires_at`.

### Backward Incompatible Changes

Prior to version `v0.7.0` `OAuth2.Client` was primarily used for the purpose
of interfacing with the OAuth server to retrieve a token. `OAuth2.Token` was
then responsible for using that token to make authenticated requests.

In `v0.7.0` this interface has been refactored so that an `OAuth2.Client` struct
now references an `OAuth2.Token` directly and many of the action methods have
been moved so that they are called on `OAuth2.Client`, with an instance of the
client struct as their first argument.

Please consult the [README](https://github.com/scrogson/oauth2/blob/v0.7.0/README.md) for an example of general usage to retrieve a token and make a request.

The following methods have been moved and adjusted so that they take a `OAuth2.Client.t` which contains a token, rather than a token directly:

- `OAuth2.AccessToken.get` -> `OAuth2.Client.get`
- `OAuth2.AccessToken.get!` -> `OAuth2.Client.get!`
- `OAuth2.AccessToken.put` -> `OAuth2.Client.put`
- `OAuth2.AccessToken.put!` -> `OAuth2.Client.put!`
- `OAuth2.AccessToken.patch` -> `OAuth2.Client.patch`
- `OAuth2.AccessToken.patch!` -> `OAuth2.Client.patch!`
- `OAuth2.AccessToken.post` -> `OAuth2.Client.post`
- `OAuth2.AccessToken.post!` -> `OAuth2.Client.post!`
- `OAuth2.AccessToken.delete` -> `OAuth2.Client.delete`
- `OAuth2.AccessToken.delete!` -> `OAuth2.Client.delete!`
- `OAuth2.AccessToken.refresh` -> `OAuth2.Client.refresh_token`
- `OAuth2.AccessToken.refresh!` -> `OAuth2.Client.refresh_token!`

Additionally, the following methods have been moved to `OAuth2.Request`

- `OAuth2.AccessToken.request` -> `OAuth2.Request.request`
- `OAuth2.AccessToken.request!` -> `OAuth2.Request.request!`

Diff: https://github.com/scrogson/oauth2/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0

## v0.5.0 (2015-11-03)

### Improvements

- You can now request a refresh token with `OAuth2.AccessToken.refresh`. The `!` alternative is also available.
